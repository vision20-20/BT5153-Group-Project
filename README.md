Modelling the Extent of Wildfires Using Machine Learning

This project made use of historical fire occurrence
data in the United States to develop a predictive
model that can accurately determine the probability
and extent of wildfire occurrences. Other climate and
socio-economic data were included to create
additional features for the machine learning
prediction models. Random Forest, Support Vector
Machine and Neural Network models were evaluated
based on the prediction accuracy and recall. It was
found that while the models were able to achieve
relatively high accuracies of up to 64%, most were
unable to predict the larger classes of fire. As such,
we simplified the models to a binary classification
task by categorizing the various classes of fire into
“small” or “large” fires. The accuracy of all the
supervised learning models improved to above 70%,
with the Neural Network model achieving up to
72.8% and with a recall for the larger fires at 78%.
